## Design Choices

I used [coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help select a color palette for the site.
I selected a variety of bright pastel colors as it is calming yet engaging at the same time.

![Color Palette](images/YarnBarnColourPalette.png)

* Color #F28428 will be used as the main background color
* Color #84A59D will be used for the nav bar as it is in high contrast to the main page color
* Color #F6BD60 will be used as a border color to highlight images and taxt areas

### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for  the fonts used for this site, I have chosen AmaticSC for the Title font and Roboto for the main text used.
